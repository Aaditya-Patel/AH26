## Marketplace Creation, Regulations, and Policies

---

## Executive Summary

The research has been compiled from three primary sources: ICAP Carbon Action Partnership, Press Information Bureau (Government of India), and carbon market resources.

## 1. WHAT ARE CARBON CREDITS?

### 1.1 Definition and Basic Concepts

**Carbon Credit**: A carbon credit represents ownership of the equivalent of one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) or one metric ton of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) that can be traded, sold, or retired. 

**Key Characteristics**:
- One credit = 1 metric ton of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e)
- Can be traded, sold, or retired
- Represents a real, verified reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
- Becomes tradeable due to actual emission reductions

### 1.2 Carbon Credit vs Carbon Offset

**Carbon Credit**:
- Issued when an organization produces fewer emissions than allocated under a cap-and-trade system
- Generated through regulated compliance activities
- Used to meet mandatory emission reduction targets

**Carbon Offset**:
- Also represents a real reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere
- Generated as a result of a project with clear boundaries, title, project documents, and verification plan
- Produces reductions outside of the organization and outside of regulatory requirements
- Common projects include: wind farms, truck stop electrification, tree planting, forest preservation

**Note**: Both credits and offsets have the same reduction benefit to the planet as CO2 has global impact, not local.

### 1.3 Types of Carbon Credits

In the Indian context:
- **Carbon Credit Certificates (CCCs)**: The official term used in India's Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)
- **Compliance Credits**: Issued under the mandatory CCTS for obligated entities
- **Voluntary Offset Credits**: Generated through voluntary projects under the Offset Mechanism

## 7. CONCLUSION

India is rapidly establishing a comprehensive carbon pricing ecosystem through the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS). The country is moving toward a rate-based Emissions Trading System that focuses on emissions intensity rather than absolute caps, providing flexibility for economic growth while achieving climate goals.

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Regulatory Framework**: Strong legal basis established through Energy Conservation Act amendments and detailed regulations
2. **Institutional Structure**: Well-defined roles for MoEFCC, MoP, BEE, NSCICM, CERC, and GCI
3. **Market Design**: Exchange-based trading through power exchanges with strong regulatory oversight
4. **Dual Mechanism**: Both compliance (mandatory) and voluntary offset mechanisms
5. **Marketplace Opportunity**: Significant opportunity exists for technology platforms to facilitate credit trading, though must operate within regulatory framework
6. **Implementation Timeline**: Trading expected to begin in 2026, with gradual rollout
7. **Scale**: Initially covering ~740 entities and 700+ million tonnes CO2e, placing India among world's largest ETS

**For Marketplace Creators**:
- Must comply with CCTS regulations
- Integration with GCI registry is essential
- Power exchange partnerships or authorization needed
- Focus on compliance buyers for initial demand
- Technology must support exchange-based trading model
- Regulatory approvals and partnerships are critical

The Indian carbon credit market represents a significant opportunity for technology companies, financial institutions, and service providers to support the transition to a low-carbon economy while creating value for market participants.
