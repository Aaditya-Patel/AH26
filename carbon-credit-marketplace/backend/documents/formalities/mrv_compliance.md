# MRV Compliance Process - Indian Carbon Market

## Overview
Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) is essential for carbon credit compliance. Obligated entities must follow BEE's MRV procedures to demonstrate compliance with GHG emission intensity targets.

## Step 1: Monitoring Plan

### Required Documents
- **Monitoring Plan Document** - Comprehensive plan outlining emissions monitoring procedures

### How to Obtain
Develop a detailed monitoring plan that specifies:
- Monitoring methodologies aligned with approved offset methodologies
- Data collection procedures and frequency
- Quality assurance and quality control measures
- Documentation requirements
- Responsibilities and personnel

Submit the monitoring plan to BEE for approval before project implementation begins.

## Step 2: Data Collection

### Required Documents
- **Data Collection Forms** - Standardized forms for recording emissions data
- **Measurement Records** - Records of actual measurements and data collected

### How to Obtain
- **Data Collection Forms**: Use BEE-prescribed data collection forms available on the BEE portal or develop custom forms aligned with your monitoring plan.

- **Measurement Records**: Maintain detailed records of all emissions measurements, including:
  - Activity data (energy consumption, fuel usage, production volumes, etc.)
  - Emission factors used
  - Supporting documentation (invoices, meter readings, laboratory reports)
  - Date and time of measurements
  - Personnel responsible for data collection

Collect data consistently throughout the reporting period as specified in your monitoring plan.

## Step 3: Report Preparation

### Required Documents
- **Emissions Report** - Comprehensive GHG emissions report for the reporting period
- **Supporting Data** - All supporting documentation and calculations

### How to Obtain
Prepare a detailed emissions report including:
- Executive summary
- Methodology applied
- Baseline emissions
- Project emissions
- Emission reductions achieved
- Data quality assessment
- Uncertainty analysis

Include all supporting data, calculations, and documentation. Ensure the report follows BEE's reporting format and guidelines.

## Step 4: Third-Party Verification

### Required Documents
- **Verification Report** - Report from Accredited Carbon Verification (ACV) Agency

### How to Obtain
Engage an Accredited Carbon Verification (ACV) Agency to verify your emissions report. The agency will:
- Review your monitoring plan implementation
- Verify data collection procedures
- Validate calculations and methodologies
- Check documentation completeness
- Assess compliance with BEE requirements
- Apply materiality threshold of 2% of total reported emissions
- Conduct independent technical review

The ACV agency will provide a verification report (Form B) certifying the verification results.

## Step 5: BEE Submission

### Required Documents
- **Final Report** - Complete verified emissions report
- **Verification Certificate (Form B)** - Certificate of verification from ACV agency

### How to Obtain
After receiving the verification report (Form B) from the ACV agency, submit your performance assessment document (Form A) along with the verified emissions report to BEE. Form A includes:
- Compliance status declaration
- Summary of verified emissions
- Details of actions taken to achieve compliance
- Supporting documentation

Submit through the BEE portal or designated submission channel. The ACV agency also submits Form B directly to BEE and the State Designated Agency (SDA).

## Step 6: Credit Surrender

After BEE approval, surrender the required number of carbon credits for compliance. Credits are surrendered through the GCI registry system.

## MRV Requirements Summary

### Materiality Threshold
- 2% of total reported emissions
- Used to identify significant discrepancies during verification

### Verification Process
- Technical competence assessment
- Calculation methodology review
- Accuracy verification of GHG emission reports
- Independent technical review by separate reviewer

### Forms Required
- **Form A**: Performance Assessment Document (submitted by obligated entity)
- **Form B**: Certificate of Verification (submitted by ACV agency)
